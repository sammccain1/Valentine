### Valentine questionnaire for partner/mother/loved one

This is a small html/javascript page that you can edit for your loved one or crush on valentine's day.

You can upload these files into any HTML code editor (VSCode, Antigravity, etc..) and edit "valentine.html" to customize the webpage for your special someone. Reference line 25 in your code editor, save and share on your preffered web hosting platform (I chose github pages for this but you can use other methods)

For styling changes, reference "valentine.css" if you wish to change any colors or wish to add anything else.

Hoping to help spread some love!!!
